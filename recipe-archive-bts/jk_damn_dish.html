    <h3>Quick Summary</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I'm not sure what this meal is. But, I think all you need to know is in this <a href="https://weverse.io/bts/live/3-115684831" target="_blank">Weverse Live</a>.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken breast, thinly sliced and diced into small pieces (could be 2 if you're making for more people)</li>
        <li>1 can tuna, drained (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 sliced yellow cheese</li>
        <li>dried parsley flakes</li>
        <li>seaweed</li>
        <li>cooked rice (white, brown, or purple)</li>
        <p>Veggie Medley:</p>
        <li>1-2 thin slices small pumpkin, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ small, yellow onion, diced</li>

        <p>Sauce:</p>
        <li>½ tbsp gochujang</li>

        <li>1 tbsp chili oil</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before cooking, dice all of your veggies as small as possible. Make sure everything is as uniform as possible. Dice your chicken and set everything aside. </li>
        <li>Unlike Jungkook, we will start by cooking the chicken. This will be a layered process in a pan on medium heat. Add your olive oil. Once it's warm, throw in your chicken and cook for about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the veggie medley to the pan and stir to incorporate with the chicken. Let this cook for 5 minutes more. </li>
        <li>Add in your tuna, you can start with 1/2 can or like JK, throw the whole can in. Stir to mix and cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now it's time to add the sauce ingredients. To start your chili oil, mix in 1/2 tbsp gochujang and garlic and make sure to mix it well (if everything seems too dry, add a bit of water so that the sauce can break down better). Add the soy sauce and sesame oil and stir well to combine. Cook for another 3 minutes. If it looks too dry, add 1-2 tsp of water at a time. </li>
        <li>With your spoon, make sure all the ingredients lay flat in a single layer. Top it with the cheese slices and garnish with the parsley flakes. Serve the dish hot with rice and seaweed and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
